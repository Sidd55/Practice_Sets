1. Give examples of algorithms with following time complexities: 

a. O(1)  ->  Accessing particular element of array

b. O(N) ->     Linear Search

c. O(log N) -> Binary Search

d. O(N logN) -> Quick Sort

e. O(MN)  - > MultiLinear Function with m and n as constants

f. O(N^2) ->   Bubble Sort

g. O(N^3) ->   3 Nested for Loops
